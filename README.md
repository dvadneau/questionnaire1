# Questionnaire app using React.

### Source Data

Data for the project is located in the `src/data.json` file. See `src/App.js`
 for usage.


### Requirements and Dependencies

See the package.json file for JS build dependencies outside of the standard 
create-react-app.

Node version 10.15.0 was used.

If you have NVM installed run `nvm use` to ensure the correct version of 
node/npm are used. See `.nvmrc`.

Yarn was used as the package manager, but npm will also work.


### Build and Launch

Installing dependencies: run `yarn`.

To build and launch using the development server: run `yarn start`.

For production deployment: run `yarn build`. The output target is the `build` 
folder, relative to the project root


### Limitation - TODO

The "multiple" type currently only returns a single value, rather than an 
array of values. Need to expand the Multiple component.


### References

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
